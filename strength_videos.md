# Strength and mobility videos 

### [Ben Felton](https://www.youtube.com/@BenIsRunning)

A newish YouTuber. Focuses on the marathon but also runs shorter distances. Podiums at small marathons and county level races. Lots of shoe review content. Has spent some time at training camps in Kenya. Gratuitous abs-show-off-pics aside, he is a fast runner and these are a couple of good detailed follow-along strength workout videos.

#### A full length follow-along core workkout session from a Kenyan running camp.

#### Another filmed workout in the gym.

A more dynamic standing up workout, mostly bodyweight with some kettlebell, or could use dumbells I guess.

### [Philly Bowden](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilyBowden)

A marathon runner, coach and YouTuber based in the North West. She has represented GB, and is aspiring to qualify for GB in the Olympic marathon in Paris next year. Lots of content focussing on her training and lifestyle.

#### Runners strength exercises

Not a *follow along* video as such, but a focused quick run through of several exercises with good demonstrations and some advice about building routines out of these. The printed summary of her strength training plans is <a href="https://www.philybowden.com/_files/ugd/9cf4b6_9196bc77bd094a3fb2bebc7ffeef14d2.pdf" target="_blank">available here.</a>

A mobility warm-up routine for use before every run or workout.

### [Ben Parkes](https://www.youtube.com/@BenParkes)

A long-established running YouTuber. Lots of stuff on YouTube, race experience content, shoe and equipment reviews, running guides of various kinds and also pushing his coaching business and online running merchandise sales. Often featuring his partner Sarah, also a runner and trainer/coach.

#### Runner's kettlebell workout

### [Stephen Scullion](https://www.youtube.com/@stephenscullion262)

The fastest of all the runners here. An Irish Olympian at the marathon and current Irish national marathon champion. Hyper focussed on the marathon and his content is all about his various trainings for this. Soft-selling his paid-for online training resources too. 

#### Some detailed exercise demonstrations in this

Lots of commentary and form tips in this one.

<hr>
These next  three are not runners, but from the body-building, calasthenics and yoga worlds.


### [Adam Sinicki, The Bioneer](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBioneer)

This guy does a lot about bodybuilding, hence the mostly topless presentation. But he has a good attitude and is very down to earth. He often cites research and puts a lot of emphasis on functional, total body training. Again, he is soft-selling full training programs and books that one can sign up to.

#### Follow along, at home, no equipment, full body workout

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GhYh21Hofro?si=V8RxcHyxYHiVJxF1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### [Tom Merrick, Bodyweight Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/@BodyweightWarrior)

This guy is a calasthenics coach.  Lots of stuff on YouTube, and soft-selling a training app with lots of detailed follow along programs training various strength and calisthenics skills. I've been using a free trial on his training app and it seems good.

#### Runner's stetching and mobility

I like this follow along video. The broom handle between the kneeling legs bit at the start seemed very effective at relieving tight calves after the marathon.

#### General follow along mobility stretching

### [Yoga with Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/@yogawithadriene)

This is proper meditative yoga, not so sporty focussed. Included for something different I guess. She has over 12 million YouTube subscribers so is on a different scale, YouTube wise, to all the others here.
