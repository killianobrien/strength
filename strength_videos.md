### Philly Bowden

A marathon runner, coach and YouTuber based in the North West. She has represented GB, and is aspiring to qualify for GB in the Olympic marathon.

#### Runners strength exercises

Not a *follow along* video as such, but a focused quick run through of several exercises with good demonstrations and some advice about building routines out of these. The printed summary of her strength training plans is <a href="https://www.philybowden.com/_files/ugd/9cf4b6_9196bc77bd094a3fb2bebc7ffeef14d2.pdf" target="_blank">available here.</a>

#### Mobility/warm-up

A mobility warm-up routine for use before every run or workout.

<hr>
These next two are not runners, but more focussed on body-building, calasthenics and general development.

### Tom Merrick, Bodyweight Warrior

This guy is a calasthenics coach.  Lots of stuff on YouTube, and soft-selling a training app with lots of detailed follow along programs training various strength and calisthenics skills. I've been using a free trial on his training app and it seems good.

#### Runner's stetching and mobility

I like this follow along video. The broom handle between the kneeling legs bit at the start seemed very effective at relieving tight calves after the marathon.

### Yoga with Adriene

This is proper meditative yoga, not so sporty focussed. Included for something different I guess. She has over 12 million YouTube subscribers so is on a different scale, YouTube wise, to all the others here.
